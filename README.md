Demonstration of testing LLM using Langchain

Langsmith is an LLM-as-a-judge approach that is used analyse the results of LLMs and maintain track of how well the model performs over time. It can be used for tasks like text generation and summarization where there is no single ground truth. To obtain accurate and customized evaluation results, it is essential to include all relevant criteria in the prompt.

I have demonstrated the testing methodology with Langsmith using a tweet generator example for movies. 

NOTE: Please make sure to add your OpenAI API key and Langsmith API key before executing the code in the notebook.
